# GitHub SMS Notifications

A simple script to text you the repo's name and subject title when you have unread GitHub notifications. It runs on Heroku with a scheduler addon (see [this](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/schedule-a-python-script-on-heroku-a978b2f91ca8) tutorial) to check for notifications every couple of hours.
